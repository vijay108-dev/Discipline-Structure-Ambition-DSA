#  My DSA Journey

Hi, I'm Vijay Singh – a Computer Engineering student who decided to take DSA seriously and stay consistent with it, one day at a time.

##  Why I Started This

I wanted to build a habit of solving problems daily and get better at Data Structures and Algorithms. I'm not just aiming to crack interviews – I actually enjoy breaking down complex problems and thinking logically. This journey is my way of keeping myself accountable and tracking my progress.

## What You'll Find Here

- Daily problem-solving logs.
- My learnings and patterns I discover.
- Code I've written with proper comments and clarity.
- Occasional notes or summaries of concepts I revise.

This isn't about speed. It's about consistency, clarity, and improvement.

##  Tech Stack

- Language: C++ (mostly)
- Platform: GeeksforGeeks, LeetCode, HackerRank, Codeforces, etc.

##  What I Believe

- DSA is not just for interviews. It builds a strong foundation for system design and optimization.
- Writing clean, understandable code matters more than one-liner hacks.
- Anyone can improve with regular practice – you just need to start and stay on track.

## 🗓️ Started On
